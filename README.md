# Ask @mtrimarchi anything!

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

[**Ask a question**](../../issues/new) / [**Read questions**](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Bitcoin. Work. Life. Networking. Whatever.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](../../issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it.
Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered,
but don't worry if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon.
Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past.
I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see,
so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
